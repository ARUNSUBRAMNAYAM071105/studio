# **App Name**: CropSafe AI

## Core Features:

- Image Analysis: Allow farmers to upload images of crops for immediate disease detection using a pre-trained AI model tool.
- Disease Diagnosis: Use an AI model to diagnose plant diseases from uploaded images, providing a confidence score for the diagnosis.
- Localized Treatment Advice: Provide treatment options and best practices tailored to the diagnosed disease and the farmer's geographic location, leveraging regional agricultural data.
- Offline Functionality: Enable core features like image analysis and treatment recommendations to work offline, syncing data when an internet connection is available.
- Early Warning System: Provide alerts for potential disease outbreaks based on weather patterns and regional reports, delivered via SMS.
- Farmer Profiles: Allow farmers to create profiles with information about their crops, land size, and location for personalized advice and data tracking.
- User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive interface with minimal text and voice-enabled navigation to cater to users with limited digital literacy.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep green (#347C6C) to reflect health, growth, and the agricultural focus. It evokes a sense of nature and reliability.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FAF5). This provides a soft, non-intrusive backdrop that complements the primary color.
- Accent color: Muted yellow (#D4AC0D). It is analogous to the green (shifted by approximately 30 degrees), but made distinct through lower saturation, to ensure it stands out without overwhelming the interface, especially for CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear, universally recognizable icons representing various crops, diseases, and treatment options, optimized for low-resolution screens.
- Implement a simple, grid-based layout with high contrast and ample spacing to improve readability and ease navigation, particularly on small screens.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions and guide the user through the app, enhancing usability.
